							    <p>Finally, the best possible Norweigan super team could actually become a reality!</p>

								<p>FaZe's Norweigan super star known as "Håvard 'rain' Nygaard" could leave FaZe after the upcoming CS:GO Major, the lackluster performance from his roster is certinatly abundantly clear. With FaZe almost not qualifying at all to the CS:GO Major Tournament held in Stockholm Avicii Globen Arena. While there has been no real rumours about rain leaving FaZe, most of the FaZe communtiy is in favor of rain leaving.</p>
								<p>As I'm typing this article EXTREMUM just announced that they have benched their entire roster. by this announcement jkaem is avaible up for grabs. Unless he goes to Complexity which would be very sad.</p>
								<p>Dignitas Awper hallzerk almost made it to the major but lost to *team*, this loss had to be hard for the Swedes and the Norweigan mustache man hallzerk. While they fought well they eventually won 2 games and lost 3. This result is really dissapointing and all so I would predict Dignitas is about to have a roster change on their hands and replace hallzerk with Chawzyyy the Swedish young AWPER talent who has shown his worth on the team Galaxy Racer/Nigma Galaxy.</p>
								<p>Grusarn the headshot machine has been benched by Apeks, it is still unsure why. Lately Polly Apeks coach has replaced Grusarn as a stand-in but the results has been lackluster. So Grusarn could be up for grabs.</p>
								<p>Now H4RR3 is another beast, this guy is always carrying his team 777 on his back, proving he's still skilled even though he didn't show too much fire power in ex roster Dignitas.</p>
								<p>vENdetta has proven that he is a reliable coach after taken over the roles from fifflaren's coaching positon. He has managed to get the team to rank #22 in the world so far, based on the HLTV Rankings, and is currently rank #30. This is a coach you would be happy to have.</p>
